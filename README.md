# Evo Car Share App Scrape

The supplied python code pulls the location of all available EVO cars as well as the current energy level of each vehicle. Since EVO no longer offer a web based booking platform, the data had to be scraped from the EVO App for Android or iOS. In order to obtain the API information, a MITM proxy and the Android EVO application were used. This python code can be used along with an automation program such as Windows Task Scheduler to retrieve the EVO car share data at a desired time interval.
